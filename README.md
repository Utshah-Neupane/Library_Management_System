📖 Overview

This project implements a relational database system to manage and analyze resume-related data. It includes SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and performing queries of varying complexity. The queries demonstrate core concepts such as filtering, joins, subqueries, aggregations, and optimization techniques.

⚙️ Features

Database Schema Creation – Tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
Data Retrieval Queries – Scripts that demonstrate filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
Complex Joins & Subqueries – Multi-table relationships explored through advanced queries.
Multiple Query Approaches – Alternative solutions (e.g., question4_a.sql and question4_b.sql) for optimization and flexibility.
Validation & Testing – Scripts like table_count_query.sql and test.sql ensure correctness.



🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

SQL – Core query language.
RDBMS – Compatible with MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (depending on environment).
Database IDEs – MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or DBeaver (for query execution and debugging).
Version Control – Git for managing scripts.
